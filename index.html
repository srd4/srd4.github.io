            Today is the 10th of november of 2019. I just spent the last five hours trying to set this website up after discovering that github actually hosts you for free. I got in touch with html, css and a bit of javascript once (five years ago or so) but most of the stuff couldn't remember it so well; today has been a complete re-discovering of web dev which somehow landed into what you are seeing.

            That is pretty much what I do all the time. Discover something and get deep into it. Most passionate programmers I've meet do the same. But there's something I've always been wanting to do, that I haven't, that thing is <strong>sharing</strong>. Having a website seemed like a nice way of putting all these things together in a single place for people to find it and learn with me.

            Weird to introduce myself at the end but, anyways... My name is <strong>Daniel Gil</strong>, I'm a Colombian engineering student. I like coding and learning. Lately I mostly do it on python and mathematics, Uni really picks your curiosity on different tecnologies that for my part I'm always willing to explore. For now let's see here you'll find Javascript, <strong>Python</strong> and C++.
